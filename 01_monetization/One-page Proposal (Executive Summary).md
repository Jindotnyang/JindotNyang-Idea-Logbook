**🧾 One-page Proposal (Executive Summary)**
Reward Station Monetization: Ads → Credits (Trust-first)

1) Problem

Free users create massive traffic but generate limited direct revenue.
Hard usage limits reduce retention and push users away.
Platforms face funding bottlenecks (compute cost vs. free-user scale).

2) Proposed Solution

Reward Station (Ads → Credits):
Users watch whitelisted, brand-safe ads

Earn usage credits

Credits unlock higher limits / priority queue / boosted features
→ Free users become a self-funding acquisition engine while staying satisfied.

3) Why This Works (Win-Win 구조)

For users

“Pay with attention” option (no cash)
Less frustration vs. hard throttling
Clear exchange value: ad time → credit

For platform

Converts free traffic into monetizable inventory
Stabilizes revenue without hurting premium subscription
Improves retention via habit loops (check-ins, streaks)

4) Key Design Rules (Trust-first)

Ads must be white-listed + quality controlled (avoid spam UX degradation)
Transparent credit pricing + audit trail
Anti-abuse: cooldowns, bot detection, risk scoring

5) Rollout Plan (Low risk)

Phase 1: Limited pilot (free tier only, opt-in)
Phase 2: Expand credit economy + priority queue options
Phase 3: Add daily check-in / streak system → retention 강화
