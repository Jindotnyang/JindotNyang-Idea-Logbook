## Title
**Reward Station Monetization Model: Ads → Compute Credits + Daily Check-in Habit Loop**

---

## Problem
- Free tier generates high inference costs, low direct revenue.
- Hard rate limits hurt retention and satisfaction.
- Monetization concentrated in paid plans and enterprise.

---

## Insight
- Reward stations (opt-in ads) are proven at scale (app-tech model).
- Daily check-in is the lowest-friction retention engine.
- AI trust is fragile → ads must never touch answer surface.

---

## Solution
### 1) Reward Station (separate UI)
- opt-in ads / missions → earn compute credits
- credits redeemable for extra messages / advanced features

### 2) Daily Check-in Credits
- daily claim + streak bonuses (7/30 days)
- optional reward boost via opt-in ads

### 3) Whitelist Ads + Trust Policy
- whitelist-only advertisers
- ban sensitive categories
- explicit statement: "Ads never influence answers"

---

## Impact
- Converts free tier from cost center → revenue center
- Increases DAU/retention via habit loop
- Builds bridge to paid conversion
- Credits enable explicit compute cost control

---

## KPIs
- DAU / D7 / D30 retention
- ARPDAU
- Reward Station adoption
- ad completion rate, eCPM
- compute cost per active user
- free → paid conversion

---

## Risks & Mitigation
- Trust risk → structural separation + transparency
- Cost risk → credit expiry + tiered consumption
- Ad quality risk → whitelist + monitoring

**🧾 One-page Proposal (Executive Summary)**
Reward Station Monetization: Ads → Credits (Trust-first)

1) Problem

Free users create massive traffic but generate limited direct revenue.
Hard usage limits reduce retention and push users away.
Platforms face funding bottlenecks (compute cost vs. free-user scale).

2) Proposed Solution

Reward Station (Ads → Credits):
Users watch whitelisted, brand-safe ads

Earn usage credits

Credits unlock higher limits / priority queue / boosted features
→ Free users become a self-funding acquisition engine while staying satisfied.

3) Why This Works (Win-Win 구조)

For users

“Pay with attention” option (no cash)
Less frustration vs. hard throttling
Clear exchange value: ad time → credit

For platform

Converts free traffic into monetizable inventory
Stabilizes revenue without hurting premium subscription
Improves retention via habit loops (check-ins, streaks)

4) Key Design Rules (Trust-first)

Ads must be white-listed + quality controlled (avoid spam UX degradation)
Transparent credit pricing + audit trail
Anti-abuse: cooldowns, bot detection, risk scoring

5) Rollout Plan (Low risk)

Phase 1: Limited pilot (free tier only, opt-in)
Phase 2: Expand credit economy + priority queue options
Phase 3: Add daily check-in / streak system → retention 강화
