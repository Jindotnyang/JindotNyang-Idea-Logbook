## Author
Proposed by: **JindotNyang**  
Timestamp: **GitHub commit history**

## Executive Summary
AI products depend on trust.
Ads can be a viable monetization strategy **only** if:
- structurally isolated from answers,
- curated via whitelist,
- and governed by strict safety rules.

---

## 1) Non-Negotiable Principles
1) Ads must never influence answers
2) Ads must never appear inside responses
3) Ads should live only in Reward Station (opt-in)
4) Transparency must be explicit and user-visible

---

## 2) Whitelist-Only Approach
### 2.1 Advertiser Qualification
To be approved, advertisers must:
- pass identity verification
- provide legal company information
- comply with ad content policies
- accept audit rights & penalties

### 2.2 Continuous Monitoring
Whitelist is not permanent:
- periodic review
- user report escalation
- automatic removal thresholds

---

## 3) Category Restrictions
### 3.1 High-Risk Categories (Restrict / Ban)
- health supplements / medical claims
- finance / trading / crypto promotions
- political persuasion ads
- gambling-like mechanisms
- adult content
- scams / get-rich-quick offers

### 3.2 Conditional Categories (Allow only with strict verification)
- banks/regulated financial institutions
- certified healthcare providers
- government/public service campaigns

---

## 4) Ad Labeling & Transparency
- show "This is an ad"
- show advertiser name
- show "Ads never influence answers"
- provide an easy report button

---

## 5) User Control
- ads are opt-in only
- allow "hide advertiser"
- allow "opt-out of categories"
- provide "why am I seeing this?"

---

## 6) Enforcement
- 1st violation: warning + removal
- 2nd violation: permanent ban
- severe violation: immediate ban + public removal log (optional)
