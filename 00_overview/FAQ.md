# FAQ — Reward Station (Ads → Credits)
**Author:** JindotNyang  
**Purpose:** Address common concerns and objections (for execs / PMs / users)

---

## Q1. “I hate ads. Why would AI have ads?”
**A. This is opt-in — not forced.**  
Ads are offered as an optional way for free users to increase usage limits by trading time (attention) instead of money.  
If users dislike ads, they can simply keep using the default free tier with existing limits.

---

## Q2. Won’t ads damage the brand image?
**A. That’s why ad whitelisting (brand safety) is a core requirement.**  
Unfiltered ads can destroy UX and brand trust. Reward Station should operate under strict rules:

- Allow only verified advertisers (whitelist)
- Block spam, gambling, adult content, political propaganda, and misinformation
- Enable user reporting and permanently remove repeat violators

Ads should not be treated as cheap banner inventory, but as a **premium, curated reward slot**.

---

## Q3. What if bots abuse the system and farm credits?
**A. Anti-abuse must be designed first, not added later.**  
Baseline protections include:

- Daily credit caps / hourly limits
- Cooldowns between rewarded views
- Bot detection + risk scoring
- Tiered rewards based on account trust level (new accounts earn less)
- Anomaly detection (repeated IP/device patterns, abnormal CTR, suspicious activity)

The more monetizable a system is, the more **security becomes part of the product design**.

---

## Q4. Won’t paid subscribers feel it’s unfair?
**A. The paid tier remains clearly superior.**
- Paid: no ads + higher reliability + priority access + highest limits
- Free: partial limit unlocks through ads (lower cap)

Reward Station does not replace subscriptions — it reduces free-user churn and improves long-term conversion.

---

## Q5. Won’t ad viewing create a bad user experience and increase churn?
**A. The UX must be short, transparent, and transactional.**
- 15–30 second units
- Credits granted immediately
- Transparent exchange rate: “1 ad = X credits”
- Users enter Reward Station voluntarily (no forced placements)

The reason “rewarded ads” work in many apps is the clarity of the value exchange.

---

## Q6. If users generate sensitive conversations, won’t advertisers avoid the platform?
**A. Ads should not appear next to conversations. Reward Station is a separate zone.**  
Instead of placing ads beside user content, Reward Station works like a “charging station” users enter intentionally.

→ This is also more brand-safe for advertisers.

---

## Q7. Does this actually generate meaningful revenue?
**A. The primary value is cost offset + retention improvement.**
Reward Station’s first-order goals:
- recover a portion of free-tier compute costs
- reduce churn and improve long-term conversion

Even if ad revenue isn’t massive at first, retention gains alone can materially improve overall unit economics.

---

## Q8. Can we use alternatives to ads?
**A. Yes — other reward sources can work as well.**
- surveys
- partner subscriptions or app installs
- partner educational content
- open-source contributions / bug reporting rewards

However, ads are typically the easiest mechanism to deploy quickly at scale.

---

## Q9. What about regulations and legal risk?
**A. Compliance must be addressed country-by-country.**
- privacy and ad targeting regulations
- protections for minors
- advertiser verification and illegal ad filtering

A safe starting point is **conservative operation**: whitelist-only + minimal/no targeting.

---

## Q10. What is the core message in one sentence?
**A.**  
Free users should not be a cost center.  
They can become a self-funding engine through opt-in, brand-safe Ads → Credits.
