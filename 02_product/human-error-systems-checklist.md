# Human-Error-Resilient Organization Checklist

## Author
Proposed by: **JindotNyang**

## Purpose
A truly “human-respecting organization” is not one that simply says polite words.  
It is an organization that **accepts human imperfection** and **designs systems to absorb errors**.

This checklist helps identify whether a team/company:
- blames individuals for mistakes, or
- improves systems so mistakes are less likely (and less harmful).

---

## Executive Summary (TL;DR)
- Human error is not an exception — it is the default.
- “Do not make mistakes” is not management; it’s violence disguised as professionalism.
- Good organizations reduce error probability and blast radius with systems:
  checklists, templates, documentation, verification, and transparency.

---

# 1) Error Culture (Most Important)
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Asks: “How did this error become possible?” (system focus)
- Mistakes lead to **process improvement**, not scapegoating
- Uses blameless postmortems / retrospective reviews
- Treats issue reporters as **risk sensors**, not troublemakers

### ❌ Red flags
- “Who made the mistake?” culture
- Public shaming / blame games / scapegoating
- “Never do it again” is the only response
- Using mistakes to destroy someone’s reputation

---

# 2) SOP / Templates (Process Maturity)
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Work is documented: SOP / playbooks / wiki
- Templates exist (plans, reports, approvals)
- New members can perform reliably by following process
- “Written record first” culture

### ❌ Red flags
- “Just figure it out” culture
- No templates; everything starts from scratch
- Work direction only delivered verbally
- People weaponize ambiguity (“I never meant that”)

---

# 3) Verification System (Review / QA)
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Review/approval process exists for high-impact work
- QA / validation stages are built-in (not optional)
- Checklists & logging exist
- Responsibility is distributed (no one-person liability)

### ❌ Red flags
- One person becomes the permanent “human firewall”
- No review → blame individual when failure happens
- Late-stage nitpicking instead of early validation

---

# 4) Psychological Safety in Communication
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Asking questions is normal
- Disagreeing is allowed without retaliation
- Debate focuses on issues, not people
- Meetings prioritize logic & evidence

### ❌ Red flags
- Questioning = incompetence framing
- Disagreement = disloyalty framing
- Power-based meeting outcomes (politics > evidence)

---

# 5) Priority & Scope Control
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Clear priorities and Definition of Done (DoD)
- Scope changes are documented with impact analysis
- Schedule collapse triggers process improvement

### ❌ Red flags
- Priorities change daily based on mood/power
- Infinite revision loops with shifting standards
- “That’s not what I wanted” after delivery (gaslighting style)

---

# 6) Transparent Decision-Making
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Decision-maker is clearly defined
- Decisions are documented with reasoning
- Meeting notes exist
- Evidence beats politics

### ❌ Red flags
- No one makes decisions (permanent delay)
- Decisions get reversed without explanation
- Talking skills > logic (power games dominate)

---

# 7) Human Limits Are Considered (Sustainable Ops)
### ✅ Healthy signals
- Burnout is treated as a system risk
- Buffer time is built into schedules
- Backup/rotation plans exist
- When workload increases: hire, automate, or reduce scope

### ❌ Red flags
- “Professionalism = overtime”
- “Mental toughness solves everything”
- Chronic understaffing normalized

---

# 8) Quick Scoring (1-minute Diagnosis)
Score each section from 0–2:
- 0 = red flags dominant
- 1 = mixed
- 2 = healthy system present

### ✅ Interpretation
- **12–14**: Human-respecting organization (system strong)
- **8–11**: Medium risk (mixed culture)
- **0–7**: High risk (people are used as replaceable parts)

---

# 9) Interview Questions (Use as a Filter Weapon)
Ask these in interviews or early collaboration:
1) Do you have SOP/playbooks/wiki for critical workflows?
2) How do you run postmortems when things go wrong?
3) What’s the QA/review process for high-impact tasks?
4) How are scope changes decided and shared?
5) How are priorities set and how often do they change?
6) Do you document decisions and meeting notes?
7) Is disagreement safe? What happens if someone challenges a plan?
8) How do you handle handoffs and knowledge transfer?
9) What happens when the schedule slips?
10) Is there a backup/rotation system?

✅ Healthy orgs answer specifically.  
❌ Toxic orgs answer vaguely: “It depends… we’re flexible…”

---

## Final Rule (One Sentence)
A human-respecting organization is not one that asks humans to be perfect.  
It is one that **assumes imperfection and builds systems to prevent harm**.
